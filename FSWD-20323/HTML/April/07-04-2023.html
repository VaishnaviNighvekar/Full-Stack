            In the below case both elements of a and b will also be popped, because JS uses call by refernce
            and hence starting address of both a,b are same hence when we use pop, then it removes the element
            at the starting address of as which is also starting address of b, hence in both array element will be
            popped. Similarly when element is pushed in b it will also be pushed in a automatically

            const a=[1,2,3,4,5]
            const b= a
            a.pop()

            b.push("element")

            after running both above codes sepratly we can see the difference between map and foreach.
            both will give same output but map has ability to return some value if defiend in the function
            and foreach does not even if fucntion is returning some value
