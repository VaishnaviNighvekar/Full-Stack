            console.log(1)

            setTimeout(()=>{
                console.log('three')

            output will be 
            1,2,three,four


            reason: as JS does not understand settimeout function(which is written in C++) hence it is ignored
            or skipped by chrome V8 engine (used to execute JS code on browser), so this engine places the functiuon
            in a queue know as task queue , where it waits to finish the JS code and then after JS code is 
            over the settimeout function is placed into call stack and then it is executed
